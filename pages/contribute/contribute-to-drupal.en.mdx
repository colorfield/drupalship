## Find development tasks

> [The Drupal development roadmap](https://www.drupal.org/core/roadmap) is targeted towards Drupal contributors hoping to jump in and make the next release a success. For an overview of the high level strategic focus areas in Drupal core for a more general audience, see [strategic initiatives](https://www.drupal.org/strategic-initiatives). For a full list of efforts that core contributors are working on, see [community initiatives](https://www.drupal.org/core/community-initiatives).

Creating a Drupal account will give you access on [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org) for contribution but also on [Drupal Groups](https://groups.drupal.org), [Drupal Jobs](https://jobs.drupal.org) and [Drupal Association](https://www.drupal.org/association) websites.

## Contribution starter kit

The community produced the **[Sprint Participant Role Task Cards](https://www.drupal.org/sprint-task-cards)**, a gamified way to introduce contribution.

They can be used during event sprints, but they are clear enough to start on your own.

While following the sprint cards, you will evolve through contribution roles:

1.  **Explorer**: You are familiar with Drupal and ready to start exploring Drupal 8.
2.  **Community Contributor**: You are an **Explorer** and ready to give back to Drupal 8.
3.  **Issue Mover**: Your are a **Community Contributor** and ready to start moving Drupal 8 issues forward.
4.  **Developer**: You are an **Issue Mover** and ready to dig into some Drupal 8 code.
5.  **Mentor**: You are an **Issue Mover** or **Developer** and are ready to help others learn to contribute too.

## Install the contribute module

> The Contribute module adds a 'Community information' section to Drupal's status report (/admin/reports/status) which encourages individuals and organizations to join the Drupal community, become members of the Drupal Association, and contribute to Drupal projects, events, and more.

## Find a mentor

When you arrive at sprints, ask for the friendly people that can help you to get started. They are most of the time well indicated and announced.

## Dreditor

[Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dreditor/dhdpoembhlojpmehepeadblhglloobao) that provides helpers for Drupal.org contribution. Since November 2017, it is [available in Firefox](https://www.millwoodonline.co.uk/blog/dreditor-for-firefox), sweet!

> Dreditor (short for Drupal editor and pronounced /'dɹɛdɪtə/) started as a simple idea for a (GreaseMonkey) browser user script to help module maintainers, Drupal core maintainers, and developers in general to review patches on . Dreditor provides multiple applications/helpers for drupal.org and implements a concept of applications/namespaces/modules. The user script can re-use all available data on drupal.org as well as common Drupal development practices.

## DrupalPod

[DrupalPod](https://www.drupalpod.com) allows you to set up a full development environment in the browser using Gitpod.
