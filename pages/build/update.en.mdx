# Update Drupal core and contributed projects

## Composer

### List outdated packages

```bash
composer outdated "drupal/*"
```

### Update Drupal core

For recent Drupal setups, based on `drupal/core-recommended`

```bash
composer update "drupal/core-*" --with-all-dependencies
```

For other cases, [read more on Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/docs/updating-drupal/updating-drupal-core-via-composer).

This is valid for non major version updates. A new section will be added for major version upgrade specifics (example Drupal 9 to 10).
You can also find [documentation on Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/docs/upgrading-drupal/upgrading-from-drupal-8-or-later/how-to-upgrade-from-drupal-9-to-drupal-10).

### Contributed projects

Update with

```bash
composer update drupal/<project_name> --with-all-dependencies
```

### Troubleshoot

Some common issues.

#### Memory limit

Run Composer with an environment variable to increase the memory limit. Example for no limitation:

```bash
COMPOSER_MEMORY_LIMIT=-1 composer update drupal/<project_name> --with-all-dependencies
```

#### Packages conflict

Check why a particular version is not installed

```bash
composer why-not <vendor>/<package> <version>
```

#### Project not compatible with a major Drupal version

There can be patches to apply, check also the [Drupal's Lenient Composer Endpoint](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-drupals-lenient-composer-endpoint) for more info.

### Patches

If you have patches, depending on the codebase change, they might not apply anymore.
You should check the issue the patch was created for and see if 
- It is still needed: the patch was committed to a release or the dev branch. The issue is closed in this case. If it's on the dev branch, you have 2 options: require the dev version or still apply the patch until it makes it to the release.
- There is a new patch available, usually a "re-roll" to comply latest codebase.
- It still needs a re-roll, then you can [contribute it](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/git/using-git-to-contribute-to-drupal/working-with-patches/making-a-patch).

Tip: to quickly find the issue, it is usually nice to have it in your composer.json file, like this:

```json
"extra": {
    "patches": {
        "drupal/core": {
            "#Issue number - Issue title": "https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/issue-1.patch"
        }
    }
}
```

## Update the database and the configuration

When doing codebase update with Composer, chances are that there could be schema updates,
so it's a good idea to run the database update and clear the cache.

```bash
drush updatedb
drush cache:rebuild
```

Some configuration changes can also be applied, run then

```bash
drush config:export --diff
```

and commit it in your repository, it will be used for the deployment.
The `--diff` is optional but helps to review the changes.

To deploy, if you are unsure about the sequence of the commands to run, have a look at the 
[Drush deploy command](https://www.drush.org/12.x/deploycommand/).

More info about deployments to be provided in [Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD)](/deploy/continuous-integration-and-delivery).
