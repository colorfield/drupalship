# Drupal projects

There are galaxies of Drupal projects, here is a short list of stable modules an themes
that can apply to common use cases + a few distributions. Most modules can interact together.

More projects can be discovered via the [Project Browser](https://www.drupal.org/project/project_browser) initiative.

## Modules

Modules are providing most of the time a single feature. They can work on their own or collaborate with other modules.
