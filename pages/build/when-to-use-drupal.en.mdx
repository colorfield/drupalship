# Is Drupal the right solution for my project?

Drupal is a Content Management System (CMS), but the community prefers to call it Content Management _Framework_ because of its versatility and the wide range of use cases it can cover.

## What do you want to build?

We will stay in the PHP world to answer this question.

*   A **blog**, a single language site with a few pages. Consider [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/), also read this post from Dries Buytaert about the [State of Drupal in 2017]( https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-september-2017) _"Drupal is no longer for simple sites"._  
*   A **simple website** with Developer Experience inspired from Drupal 7. Have a look at the [Backdrop](https://backdropcms.org/) fork of Drupal. If you come from Drupal 6 or 7 the [list of modules](https://backdropcms.org/modules) should look familiar.  
*   An **e-commerce** website. Consider [Magento](https://magento.com/), or give [Drupal Commerce](/project/distribution/commerce) a try.  
*   A **community building** site? Try Drupal [Open Social](https://www.getopensocial.com/).  
*   A **decoupled frontend** based on React (Gatsby, Next.js), Vue.js, ... 
Try [Next.js for Drupal](https://next-drupal.org/) or just install the Drupal core with [JSON API](https://www.drupal.org/project/jsonapi) or [GraphQL](https://www.drupal.org/project/graphql).  
*   An **application** focused on business logic. Consider [Laravel](https://laravel.com/).  
*   A solution that plays well with **[CiviCRM](https://civicrm.org/)** (e.g. webforms for events or mailing list, contact to user mapping, ...), an **award** website, a **crowdfunding platform**, a **umbrella association** website, ... . Your criteria are multi-user based, multilingual, web service capable, evolutive, secure, enterprise level and stable. Well, you are definitely on the right place to start with Drupal.

### A word about decoupled CMS as a service

SaaS Solutions are all the rage since a few years (Contentful, Prismic, ...) so why should
we use Drupal instead? Indeed, depending on the content model and requirement, that might be a good fit
for your project.

Some key points are still making Drupal a good candidate for a decoupled CMS
- It is mature (to not say "boring") technology, there are more than 20 years of edge case debugging behind. This comes with the luxury of having a stable, well tested and predictable ecosystem
- Content is king 
  - Flexible content models is its strength, no matter which use case you throw at it, there is a solution
  - Content moderation and complex Workflows are customizable easily
  - Content can be delivered to several Drupal instances
  - With JSON:API or GraphQL, you can deliver to any frontend
- The access control layer is one of the most fine grained and complete
- It is fully multilingual, and translation sync is possible at a field level
- It easily enables integration to translation jobs automation (machine translation, ...) or third party systems
- There is freedom of choice, with multiple editorial approaches (CKEditor 5, Layout Builder, Paragraphs, Gutenberg, ...)
- There is no licence to pay by user, page, ...
- It has a powerful migration system if you are coming from another solution

## Why Drupal?

Drupal makes the difference with other systems on the following points.  
They are exposed from a persona perspective.

### The project manager

*   **Flexibility**  
    Never get stucked again. If your Drupal projects grows in terms of features and data model, Drupal has the flexibility of a good friend.
*   **_Fully_ [multilingual](/build/common-site-building-tasks)**
*   **Community features**  
    Fine grained permission system and publication workflow.
*   **Third party integration**  
    With web services, spread your content on several channels or applications (Drupal frontend, React, Apple watch, ...). It also allows you to integrate it with third parties applications (CRM, ERP, …).
*   **Security**  
    The [Drupal Security team](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-security-team/general-information) is working hard to [keep the Drupal core and contributed projects secure](/build/security-updates).
*   **Scalability**  
    Your project can also grow in terms of traffic and content, Drupal comes out of the box with progressive solutions of caching.  
    For small projects, just enable the page and blocks caching + the CSS/JS aggregation in two clicks. For more advanced projects, use cache tags, lazy builder or a Varnish proxy. For performance, have a look at the Big Pipe module that is now stable in core.

### The author

*   **Content authoring and workflow**  
    Out of the box CKEditor 5 (WYSIWYG), Media handler, content revision, publication workflow, scheduled publication, … All that you can imagine as an author is just waiting for you.
*   **Multilingual**  
    Drupal is fully multilingual. You can translate everything (content, configuration, …) in any language.  
    You can also translate your content in several languages and switch between them easily.
 *  **Multiple editorial experiences**
    Drupal is not a one size fits all solution. You can choose between several editorial experiences (CKEditor 5, Layout Builder, Paragraphs, Gutenberg, ...).     
    Check out the [Editorial solutions](/build/modules-themes-distributions#editorial-solutions).

### The frontender

*   **Mobile-first**  
    Drupal comes out of the box ("in core") with a responsive administration UI and frontend theme, _Responsive images_ and _Breakpoint_ modules.
*   **Divitis and classitis free**  
    These are (almost) things from the past. Drupal comes with clean semantic markup out of the box.
*   **Accessibility**  
    Drupal is committed to accessibility. The [Accessibility Statement](https://www.drupal.org/about/accessibility) is a good starting point.
*   **Frontend and backend themes**
    Drupal comes with a default frontend theme (Bartik) and a default backend theme (Seven).  
    The frontend theme is a good starting point for your own theme.  
    The backend theme can be used as a base theme for your own administration theme.  
    Both are responsive and mobile-first.
 *  **Decoupling**
    Drupal can be API first. It means that you can use Drupal as a backend and any frontend technology you want.  
    The [JSON:API](https://www.drupal.org/project/jsonapi) and [GraphQL](https://www.drupal.org/project/graphql) modules are in core.  
    There are also several contributed modules to help you to build a decoupled Drupal website.  
    Have a look at the [Web services and decoupling](/build/modules-themes-distributions#web-services-and-decoupling) modules.   


### The backender

*   **Wonderful APIs for developers**  
    Probably one of the biggest strength of Drupal: the Developer Experience (DX).  
    There was almost a U turn between Drupal 7 and 8 and the amount of work to get there was \*huge\* (link to pillars), but wait we are now on 8.4.x and Drupal 8 is becoming really mature on a developer perspective. [Read more over Drupal API's](/node/50)
*   **A talented and welcoming community**  
    Another biggest one :). The place doesn’t matter: the issue queue (link), IRC (link), Slack (link), Drupal events (internal link), there will always be someone to help, even if you are a beginner.
*   **Based on well adopted standards**  
    One of the main criticism of Drupal 7 were the Drupalisms (custom solutions and jargon).  
    Drupal now is off its island and based on vendors like Symfony, Composer, PHP Unit, ...
*   **A predictable and progressive [release cycle](/develop/drupal-8-release-cycle)**
*   **Web services**  
    The Drupal core provides a _RESTful Web Services_ module. The [JSON:API](http://jsonapi.org/) standard is also in core and [GraphQL](https://www.drupal.org/project/graphql) is supported by a contributed module.
*   Content and configuration [migration](/develop/migrate-content-another-website) helpers
