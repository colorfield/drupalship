# About this project

![The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Drupal Planet](/assets/images/docs/hitchhikers-guide-planet-drupal.jpg)

This documentation is for Drupal newcomers and evaluators.

It aims to provide a starting point for anyone who wants to know a bit more about Drupal.

When using Drupal, you have the luxury to have documentation for basically anything that you want to throw at the CMS.
Drupal.org, Drupal Answers, great blogs, books, ... are a gold mine when you know where to look or just what to search.
But as a newcomer, with the amount of documentation, sometimes you just need to step back a bit and get the big picture.

Even though the Drupal learning curve is known as steep, for most cases, you can already have an MVP rather quickly, if you know where to start.

Feedback, suggestions, and contributions are more than welcome! We can discuss this on the Drupal Slack channel [#drupalship](https://drupal.slack.com/archives/C05K39E58JU).

## Questions that this guide can answer

- [Is Drupal the right solution for my project?](/build/when-to-use-drupal) I want to quickly compare with other solutions and have arguments to convince (or not) my client, my manager... or myself 
- [I have 5 minutes today, is it enough to install Drupal?](/build/installation#fast-local-installation)
- As an evaluator, [I have a few hours to try Drupal, what should I learn first?](/build/concepts)
- As a developer, [which tools, best practices, Drupal concepts should I know about?](/develop/toolkit-for-drupal-developers)
- As a site builder, I have a few initial use cases to cover, [which modules can I install?](/build/modules-themes-distributions)
- [Where can I meet Drupal people?](/meet/events)
- [Where can I find Drupal jobs or services?](/work/work-with-drupal)
- As a translator, writer, developer, ... [how can I contribute to Drupal?](/contribute/contribute-to-drupal)
- [Do Drupal speak with bots?](/build/ai)
- I'm ready to deploy! [Where can I host my site?](/deploy/drupal-hosting-for-evaluation-and-production) and [are there specific points to check for production environments?](/deploy/production-checklist)

## What it does not cover

- In-depth documentation, we have Drupal.org for that
- Code snippets, there are plenty of good resources, like [Drupal at your fingertips](https://selwynpolit.github.io/d9book/) from Selwyn Polit
- Drupal 7, this site focuses on Drupal 9 and 10

## How it started

This project is a personal initiative that has no direct link with Drupal.org, apart from the inspiration that the community gives in my daily life.

It came from the observation that, as a developer coming from another stack, it took me some time and the luck to meet the right persons to be aware of the richness of the Drupal ecosystem and the people that make it live.

So, to take a programming analogy, this site intends to act like a [facade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern) on the Drupal ecosystem.

The initial version was launched in 2017, it was welcomed by the community but some changes in my personal life made me put it on hold.

During Drupal Mountain Camp 2022, after attending the session from Miro Dietiker [A learning group to get started with Drupal](https://drupalmountaincamp.ch/sessions/learning-group-get-started-drupal), I realized that this project could still be useful. It might not cover all the points, but that could be a starter. A few discussions later, with other community members, and it was time to give it another life - with a new design and structure.

### What are the changes compared to the first version?

- üìÑ Clearer documentation
- 1Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ Full review and update for Drupal 10
- üôå Collaborative model, based on pull requests
- üá´üá∑ French translation
- üåë Dark theme

## The name Drupalship

Being a Star Trek fan, I definitely wanted to bring a space reference here.

Another reason is that Drupal.org provides a blog aggregator on https://www.drupal.org/planet, so I also wanted to hold a reference to this well known resource that demonstrates how active the community is.
