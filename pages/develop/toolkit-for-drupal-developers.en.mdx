# Drupal tools for developers

## IDE

Let's start with your most used tool!

Two references here:

### PHPStorm

Nothing beats [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) for a Drupal job.
Composer, Git, Docker, Xdebug, Drupal coding standards, web services support, Drupal indentation style
and perfect autocompletion with inline documentation. 

Also, it has support for many plugins Twig, Symfony, Laravel, Blade, Gitignore, Markdown, ...
It's not free, but you can get a free license if you are a [student](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students) or an [open source contributor](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/opensource/#support).

- [Keyboard shortcuts for PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/mastering-keyboard-shortcuts.html)

### VSCode

It is free and has a lot of plugins, that still need to be configured to get a similar level of integration as PHPStorm.

## Configure your development environment

### Caching

Drupal comes with great caching for production, but before you start development tasks, there is some configuration to prevent caching.

[Disable Drupal caching during development](https://www.drupal.org/node/2598914)

### Twig debug

Displaying the Twig templates used by regions, blocks, nodes, ...

```yaml filename="development.services.yml"
parameters:
  twig.config:
    debug: true
```

Then cache rebuild
`drush cr`

This will become even simpler with Drupal 10.1.0

*   [Discovering and Inspecting Variables in Twig Templates](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/theming/twig/discovering-and-inspecting-variables-in-twig-templates)

## Debugging

### Var dumper

Symfony dumper is available out of the box via

```php
dump($myVar);
```

Use [Devel](https://www.drupal.org/project/devel) that provides var dumper improvements with [Kint](https://github.com/kint-php/kint).

```
composer require --dev drupal/devel
composer require --dev kint-php/kint
drush en devel
```

then configure it in /admin/config/development/devel and use in code `kint($myVar)` or `ksm($myVar)`.

### Step debugger

Install [XDebug](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/development-tools/xdebug-debugger)

## Drush CLI

Drush is a command line shell interface for Drupal. To require it in your project, use Composer.
It is advised to require it per project and not globally, so you can use different versions of Drush for different projects.

```bash
composer require drush/drush
```

Then you can use it with `vendor/bin/drush` or `vendor/bin/drush cr` for example.


To dig your way out of the list of commands, use grep: `drupal list | grep service`
Drush can be extended with your own commands, so contributed modules are often providing specific commands.

Here is a short list of most used Drush commands.

### Site installation from configuration

`drush si -y standard --sites-subdir default --account-name admin --account-pass admin --existing-config `

### Cache

- Cache rebuild `drush cr`
- Cache clear `drush cc` then select which one
- Cache get `drush cg [cid] [bin]` or set `drush cs [cid] [bin]`

### User login

- as user 1 `drush uli` (user-login)
- as another user `drush uli --uid 2` or `drush uli [name]`

### Configuration

- export `drush cex`
- import `drush cim`
- partially import `drush cim --partial --source=/path/to/module/config/install`

### Database

- Open SQL CLI `drush sql:cli`
- SQL Query `drush sql:query ["SELECT * FROM users"]`
- Sanitize (remove or obfuscate user data) `drush sql:sanitize`
- Database update `drush updb`
- SQL dump `drush sql:dump --result-file=auto --gzip`

### Delete entities

- Delete all article nodes `drush entity:delete node --bundle=article` 

### Sync environments

- Sync DB, skip tables `drush sql:sync @self.prod @self --skip-tables-list=redirect_404,cache_*`
- rsync files, exclude files `drush rsync @self.prod:%files/ @self:%files/ --exclude-paths=css:js:php/twig`

### Evaluate PHP code

- `drush php-eval "echo drupal_get_installed_schema_version('my_module');"`

### Queue

- List queues `drush queue:list`
- Run a queue `drush queue:run [name]`

### Logs

- Filter the logs interactively `drush watchdog:list`

## Code quality

### Static analyzer

### Coding standards

[PHP Code Sniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) is a library that tokenises PHP, JavaScript and CSS files and detects violations of a defined set of coding standards.

#### Check Drupal coding standards

`phpcs --standard=Drupal --extensions=php,module,inc,install,test,profile,theme,css,info,txt,md /file/to/drupal/example_module`

#### Automatically fix coding standards

`phpcbf --standard=Drupal --extensions=php,module,inc,install,test,profile,theme,css,info,txt,md /file/to/drupal/example_module`
