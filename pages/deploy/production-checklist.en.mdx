# Production Checklist

This checklist is also available with the [Production Checklist](https://www.drupal.org/project/production_checklist) module.

You might also want to review [Production check & Production monitor](https://www.drupal.org/project/prod_check).

- **Disable error display**  
Disable any errors to be displayed on the frontend.
- **Core search**  
Disable core search if not relevant or if a replacement search is used (Search API, ...).
- **Enable Syslog** core module and optionally disable Database Logging for performance.  
Logs and records system events to syslog.

## Projects review

Core, modules and themes.

- **Uninstall development modules** like Devel (Devel, Devel generate, Kint, Webprofiler).
- **Unused modules**  
Uninstall and remove unused modules.
- **Unused themes**  
Uninstall and remove unused themes.

## Vendors, custom code and libraries

- **Remove development vendors like PHPUnit, Behat.**  
Run `composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader` - 
[Composer install documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#install)
- **Remove unused libraries.**  
Check the /libraries directory
- **Node modules**  
Check if Node modules dedicated to SASS build, ... are not in the deployed codebase.
- **PHP Mess Detector**  
Run PHP Mess Detector on custom code.  
[PHP Mess Detector](https://phpmd.org/)
- **PHPCS**  
Run the phpcs command on custom code.  
[PHP Coding Standards](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards/coding-standards)

## Spam related configuration and modules

- **Review user registration**  
Depending on the use case, new account creations can be limited to administrators.
- **Check permissions for content creation**  
Node, terms, media, ... related permissions.
- **Check permissions for comment creation**

- **Email obfuscation**  
Are the email addresses protected against bots harvesting? In fields, via the WYSIWYG, Twig templates, ...

## Security and access control

This topic can be extended with [Site Audit](https://www.drupal.org/project/site_audit) and [Security Review](https://www.drupal.org/project/security_review). Basically, test simultaneous and consequent anonymous access scenarios and behavior when every cache is enabled.

- **Drupal and other projects update**  
Are all the security updates applied?
- **Review the permissions**  
This should be done for each role.
- **Input format**  
Make sure that input formats are correctly configured. Full HTML should be avoided for untrusted users.
- **Admin user name**  
The user 1 name (or other users that have the administrator role) should not be defined as 'admin' so it will be harder to guess for attackers.
- **Check passwords**  
Passwords should be hard to guess, especially for author and admin roles. Use a module like Password Policy.
- **Review access denied errors**  
If needed block IP addresses with the core Ban module. This process can be completed with the recent log messages.
- **Changelog**  
Do not publish CHANGELOG.txt and other .txt files at the root of the code base.
- **Staging and dev environments**  
Make sure that your staging and dev environments does not contain sensitive data and are non indexable (headers) and/or protected with Shield (basic auth) if accessible from the outside.

Remove unused content types, vocabularies, roles, fields, ...
- **Remove dummy content**  
Content, terms, users, ... dedicated to site building (e.g. devel generated) should not be there.

Check the 403 page layout. Provide options to login and redirect to the accessed route.
- **Favicon**  
Provide favicons in several formats.

## Database and configuration

- **Check database update**  
Run /update.php, get a backup first.

## Performance and caching configuration

To go deeper, consider using [Varnish Purge](https://drupal.org/project/varnish_purge), [Memcache](https://drupal.org/project/memcache), [Advagg](https://drupal.org/project/advagg).  
  
- **Caching**

- **BigPipe**  
Consider enabling the BigPipe module.
- **Views**  
Checks views caching (on a View edit: Advanced > Other > Caching).
- **Custom code**  
Check cache tags and invalidation.
- **Audit performances**  
Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insight or Acquia Insight.  
[Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) | [Acquia Insight](https://www.acquia.com/resources/collateral/acquia-insight-data-sheet)
- **Profilers**  
Use profilers like XHProf or Blackfire.  
[XHProf Drupal.org documentation](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/development-tools/xhprof-code-profiler) | [Blackfire.io](https://blackfire.io/)

## Various test coverages

- **Manual test**  
Test the website for each role, anonymous included. Test with caches enabled. Use [Masquerade](https://drupal.org/project/masquerade) to substitute as other users.  
- **Run PHPUnit tests**  
Use them before a deployment: Functional, Kernel, Javascript, ...  
- **Continuous Integration system**  
Use tools that fits your needs like Travis CI, CircleCI, Jenkins.  
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) | [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) | [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)

## Analytics

- **Google Tag Manager**  
Is the [Google Tag Manager](https://drupal.org/project/google_tag) module installed and configured?
- **Google webmaster tools**  
Are Google webmaster tools configured?

You may consider alternatives like [Matomo](https://www.drupal.org/project/matomo) or [Plausible](https://plausible.io/).

## Server configuration and backups

- **Backups**  
Make sure that you have database and files backups enabled. Use a module like [Backup Migrate](https://drupal.org/project/backup_migrate).
- **Mails**  
Have mails being tested for each form (e.g. password reset). Is a third party needed, like Mandrill or Sendgrid? Are SPF, DKIM and PTR ok?
- **SSL certificate**  
Free SSL certificates are available from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
- **Maximum file upload size**  
This should be set in your per vhost php.ini configuration if available. Set `post_max_size` and `upload_max_filesize` (Apache)  according to your needs.
- **Maximum memory and execution time**  
This should be set in your per vhost php.ini configuration if available. Set `memory_limit` et `max_execution_time` (Apache) according to your needs.
- **Check files / directories permissions and ownership**  
Usually one owner and group per virtual host, files at 644 and directories at 755.
- **Check cron jobs**  
Modules like Scheduler should work properly. If you have custom cron jobs, check if your system cron is executed on startup and configured properly for your user.
- **Monitor your server and check the server load**  
Configure your monitoring, optionally use a service like New Relic. Will your server support peaks?  
[New Relic](https://newrelic.com/)
- **Reverse proxy**  
If your production server uses a proxy or load balancer, configure it in your settings.php.

## Basic SEO
